All dataset are stated in Google Drive.
Original dataset included this project can be reached by following link: https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/flame-dataset-aerial-imagery-pile-burn-detection-using-drones-uavs

First, we create the path to reach the dataset.
Split Training Data into training(80%) and validation(20%) subsets while creating datagens with an aimed target_size.
Printed and plotted the amount of data which are already labeled as Fire and No_Fire.
Showing some images from both Fire and No_Fire folders belong to the Training Folder.
Defining a function including convolution layers, activation functions and other required operations in order to return a model.
Summarize model.
Compiling Model.
Fitting model using fit_generator.
Plotting training and validation accuracies.
